Add custom labels to your pages/posts/projects so that you can be easily identified them in your dashboard.



== Description 

==
Not all page/posts/projects titles are as simple or as identifiable as "Contact Us" or "Landing Page". More often theyâ€™re carefully crafted and even a bit lengthy. 
For example, "Contact Us" becomes "You can land on this Page to Contact Us." 

Identifying those pages on the All Pages Screen can be a challenge for a busy site admin looking to make quick edits.


Custom Labels for WordPress Posts allows you to add a more descriptive label to your pages/posts/projects, displayed in an admin column on the pages/posts/projects screen so that pages/posts/projects can be easily identified.
